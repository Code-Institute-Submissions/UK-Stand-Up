![UK STAND UP](/readme-documents/uk-stand-up-head.png)

UK STAND UP is a project celebrating UK rap artists. Through API technologies you will be able to view different artists biographies, social links, 
view a small discography with links to the artists music and see the social media the artist has. There will also be a main image of the artist.
The website is a one page site but this will completely change depending on the artist due to the information received from the API's.

 ## UX

 This website will be created for enthusiasts of UK rap. The site users will be supporters of individual artists, the genre as a whole,
 and even possible other music fans interested in expanding their knowledge of music. The website will be a simple, stylish website. It will be easy to navigate
 through, showcasing some of the U.K's best rappers.

 * As a user I can see what the main focus of the website is.
 * As a user I can read a brief history of UK rap.
 * As a user I will be able to search different artists.
 * As a user I can read a biography on each artist.
 * As a user I can see a photo of the artist.
 * As a user I can see a small discography of the artist with spotify links to the artists music.
 * As a user I can navigate myself to any social media the artist has.
 
My wireframes were made using [Balsamic Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjw_qb3BRAVEiwAvwq6VoxJmpo6YvKPm4Qr_cVEjXzA8ve5qDOPE7VZbqIWtsFXiAf3okxfpxoCWF0QAvD_BwE). You can view them [here](/readme-documents/uk-wireframes.pdf).

## Existing Features

 * A select bar to select your favourite artists
 * A biography of each chosen artist.
 * Thumbnails of the artists discography with links taking you to that particular song or album on spotify using happi and last.fm API's.
 * Social links for each individual artist opening the associated web pages in a new window using happi and last.fm API's.
 * A biography and photo of each chosen artist using happi and last.fm API's.

 ### Features left to implement

* In the future I would like to use an API that also uses back-end development such as Spotify. This way I could also implement some form of music player. 
I could also implement a top tracks playlist for the artists.

* I would also like to implement a larger artists search bar. The Happi API I am using requires an artist ID number instead of name. If I was able to use the spotify API it would be possible to search the artist by name. 
Also if I had more time, I could have added more javascript in order to search the artist's ID numbers. This is something I will implement in the future.

* I would also like to implement a section for tour dates. I looked at two seperate API's for this. I had to apply for keys which I am still waiting for. 
I also looked at the Ticket Master API but the artists were not well known enough to have their tour dates on this API.
 
## technologies used

* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.

* [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.

* [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.

* [J. Query (3.4.1)](https://jquery.com/download/)

jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax.

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

Google Fonts (previously called Google Web Fonts) is a library of 991 free licensed font families, an interactive web directory for browsing the library, 
and APIs for conveniently using the fonts via CSS[1] and Android.

* [Bootstrap (4.4.1)](https://getbootstrap.com/)

An open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS.

* [Font Awesome (V5.6.3)](https://fontawesome.com/)

A toolkit for icons.

* [API technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)

An application programming interface (API) is a computing interface which defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries.

## Testing

* Having written my code for my .html page I have validated it on [The W3C Markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/). 

I acknowledge that there is a warning for an empty H2 element. This is filled when the API is activated.

* I have validated my css on [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). 

* My Javascript has been tested using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/).

This website was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Microsoft edge.) It is also responsive, 
having tested it on chrome developer tools across ipad, various iphones, samsungs etc. I have also tested it on iphone x, iphone 7, macbook and desktop.

### User stories Testing

* As a user I will be able to search different artists.

I have been through each individual artist and checked that there is the correct bio, 
photo, albums and social links and these are responsive on all platforms.

* As a user I can see a small discography of the artist with spotify links to the artists music.

I have checked if each album link goes to the correct album on spotify by clicking upon each link.

* As a user I can navigate myself to any social media the artist has.

I have checked that each social media link goes to the correct artists social media account by clicking on each of the links.
 I acknowledge that the artist Kojey Radical's twitter link is not correct. I believe the API has the incorrect information.

### Problems Encountered

During the project I encountered some small problems,

* The first problem I had was how to put multiple album covers and album links into a div using a for loop.
 I solved this by placing the elements into a variable first, but the next problem was that the new variable output some text stating undefined at the beginning of the variables. 
 I removed this text with another variable then placed the variable into the div.

* Another problem I encountered was while viewing my website on my mobile, the description texts of the artists weren't so clear.
 I hadn't experienced this problem in chrome developer tools. It must be something involving screen resolution so I adjusted the font weight.

* I also witnessed some problems with image scalability when recieving artist images from the API's which I found relatively difficult to adjust. 
I overcame the problem with zoom and media queries.

* On the iphone 5/SE on developer tools I discovered that my texts for one artist was overflowing it's div. 
I adjusted the font sizes in media queries for this sized screen.
